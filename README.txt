Compiler for the MaML programming language
Created by Ho-Yon Mak
------------------------------------------

Building requires the stack build tool, which will automatically download the
necessary Haskell compiler and all dependencies.

To build:

$ stack build

Prebuilt executables for Linux x86_64 and macOS are provided in the bin
directory.

See the report appendix for detailed usage instructions.
